[Start] --> [Generate initial population of candidate solutions using a GA] --> [Train a GAN on the population of candidate solutions to generate new candidate solutions] --> [Add the new candidate solutions to the population] --> [Evaluate fitness of each candidate solution] --> [Use selection, crossover, and mutation operators to generate a new population of candidate solutions] --> [Apply a local search algorithm to the best solution found] --> [End for]

After each iteration of the GA:
    --> [Train the GAN on the population of candidate solutions to generate new candidate solutions] 
    --> [Add the new candidate solutions to the population] 
    --> [Evaluate fitness of each candidate solution] 
    --> [Apply a local search algorithm to the best solution found] 
    --> [End for]

[Return the best solution found] --> [End]
